/**
 * Perform the MicroSPARC Key Perfect checksum V5.
 * <p/>
 * Notes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The V5 routine is called from the V4 routine, so lots of V4 applies here
 *     (and isn't part of the pasted assembly -- see V4)</li>
 * <li>Checksums ignore whitespace except for Ctrl+D (spaces are ignored)</li>
 * <li>Lower case is converted to upper case (LINE_BYTES_READ indicates code
 *     is being read instead of the line number)</li>
 * <li>When REM is encountered, the REM token goes into the checksum but the
 *     REM contents do not</li>
 * <li>Note that CSUM_V5_1 is really more of a temp storage field and not a
 *     part of the checksum</li>
 * <li>The values are printed in reverse order (for example, 5,4,3,2)</li>
 * </ul>
