/**
 * A {@code CodeMark} marks a dynamic address within the output stream. When referenced, it will report the
 * most recent address is knows, forcing the generation to run multiple times until it "settles".  
 * <p>
 * Multiple passes occur for the following reasons:<ul>
 * <li>an assembly address can be calculated on the second pass (1st is to actually calculate address and 2nd pass is to 
 *     use that address).</li>
 * <li>Applesoft BASIC encodes the address as text; that means first pass, the address is "0" but 2nd pass the address is
 *     likely to be 4 digits "8123" (for example) which, in turn moves anything after that point, requiring a 3rd pass
 *     to push everything out (and likely making that number become "8126" since going from 1 digit to 4 digits adds
 *     3 bytes to the preceding bytes</li>
 * </ul>
